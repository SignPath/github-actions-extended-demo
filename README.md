# Using SignPath with GitHub Actions

This project demonstrates signing artifacts using [SignPath](https://about.signpath.io) from GitHub Actions workflows.

Signing is invoked in the `sign` step of [.github/workflows/build-and-sign.yml](.github/workflows/build-and-sign.yml). 

See [github.com/SignPath/github-actions](https://github.com/SignPath/github-actions) for a full documentation of SignPath actions.

## Policy demonstrations

This project demonstrates the following attempts to violate SignPath policies and how they are averted on the control plane:

* This step selects the appropriate [signing policy] depending on the branch name. The actual branch must match the branch condition of the selected signing policy. The [`attempt-signing-release`] branch demonstrates how SignPath will detect incorrect attempts.
* The [`release/malicious-dll`] branch demonstrates how SignPath will detect content-level violations of the [artifact configuration].
* The `release/no-branch-rulesets` branch demonstrates how SignPath can be configured to require certain branch ruleset rules.

## Configuration

To use this demo with your own SignPath subscription, you need to get access to SignPath's GitHub Actions integration and have the branch ruleset restriction enabled and configured. Please contact support@signpath.io.

* Fork this repository
  * Uncheck _Copy the main branch only_
* In your SignPath organization, create a project with 
  * Slug: `Demo_Application` 
  * Repository URLs: Your forked GitHub repository, e.g. `https://github.com/my/github-actions-extended-demo`
  * Trusted Build Systems: Link _GitHub.com_
  * Add the following artifact configuration as default: [.signpath/artifact-configurations/default.xml](.signpath/artifact-configurations/default.xml)
  * Add a `test-signing` signing policy
  * Add a `release-signing` signing policy with origin verification enabled and restricted to `main` and `release/*` branches
* Create an [API token] in SignPath and add it as a GitHub Actions secret `SIGNPATH_API_TOKEN` (make sure the user is a submitter in your signing policies)
* Add your SignPath _Organization ID_ as a GitHub Actions variable `SIGNPATH_ORGANIZATION_ID` (click your organization's name at the upper right corner)
* For now, create an access token with `metadata:read` permissions on your repository and pass it as the `extended-verification-token`. _(Note: this will be replaced by GitHub App access soon.)_
* Enable Actions for your GitHub repository
